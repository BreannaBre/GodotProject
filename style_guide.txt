For making sure things render in the proper order:
	"CanvasItem -> Ordering -> Z as Relative" = off
	"CanvasItem -> Ordering -> Z Index" should follow the following conventions:
		0: background
		1: ship background
		2: ship rooms
		3: enemies
		4: players
		5: ship room decorations

For making sure things collide properly:
	"CollisionObject2D -> Collision -> Layer":
		The layers are named based on what type of thing it is. You should
		probably select one.
	"CollisionObject2D -> Collision -> Mask":
		These are the same layers, but these values control what you can stop
		you (but now what can be stopped by you).
	Additionally, all rooms should have an Area2D that bounds it. It should be
	an immediate child of the main body. It should be on the "Room" layer and
	have no mask. This is so that the mouse can click it.

Room Defaults:
	"RigidBody2D -> Physics Material" = room_physics_material.tres
	Everything else should be handled by Room.defaults()

For importing svg's:
	under import settings, they should be at 4x scale.
	In game, they should be scaled down to 0.247
