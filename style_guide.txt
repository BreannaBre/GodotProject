For making sure things render in the proper order:
	"CanvasItem -> Ordering -> Z as Relative" = off
	"CanvasItem -> Ordering -> Z Index" should follow the following conventions:
		0: background
		1: ship background
		2: ship rooms
		3: enemies
		4: players
		5: ship room decorations

For making sure things collide properly:
	"CollisionObject2D -> Collision -> Layer":
		The layers are named based on what type of thing it is. You should
		probably select one.
	"CollisionObject2D -> Collision -> Mask":
		These are the same layers, but these values control what you can stop
		you (but now what can be stopped by you).

Room Defaults:
	"RigidBody2D -> Physics Material" = room_physics_material.tres
	Everything else should be handled by Room.defaults()
